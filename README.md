# VisionaryAI
🌄 Stable Diffusion Image Generation Project
🚀 Overview
This project provides a simple yet powerful implementation for generating high-quality images using Stability AI's Stable Diffusion v2.1 model. The script handles the entire pipeline from model loading to image generation and saving, with optimizations for GPU performance.

✨ Features
🎨 Easy-to-use implementation of Stable Diffusion v2.1

⚡ GPU-optimized with memory management

🖼️ Supports custom resolutions and aspect ratios

🚫 Includes negative prompting for better control

💾 Automatic image saving functionality

🛠️ Error handling and resource cleanup

📋 Requirements
Python 3.8+

PyTorch with CUDA support

NVIDIA GPU (recommended) or compatible hardware

Required Python packages:

torch

diffusers

transformers

matplotlib

🔧 Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stable-diffusion-generator.git
cd stable-diffusion-generator
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or manually:

bash
pip install torch diffusers transformers matplotlib
🎮 Usage
🏁 Basic Generation
bash
python generate_image.py
Generates a default landscape (forest during sunset) and saves as park_mountain.png.

🎨 Custom Generation
Modify these in the script:

python
prompt = "your custom prompt here"  
negative_prompt = "terms to avoid"  
width, height = 1024, 768  # Custom resolution  
num_inference_steps = 30   # More steps = better quality ⏳  
🖥️ Command Line (Optional)
For flexibility:

bash
python generate_image.py --prompt "majestic castle" --width 1920 --height 1080
